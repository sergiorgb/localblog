This is one of those quintessential records that are my sorta thing. I mean, it's Radiohead, I'll always find a reason to like it. It was released at a time where the band was experimenting with electronica, and Thom Yorke's low tenor voice complements this album's atmosphere perfectly.

The record starts with a great song in 10/4, Everything In Its Right Place. Honestly, it's quite hard to describe a song like this one, but it's texture and base harmony/beat are just mindblowing.  They just don't make album openers like this nowadays yk.

Then there's a big change in mood with Kid A, the vocals are soft yet robotic, it's pretty much this album's manifesto.  Same goes for In Limbo, which I also love, though this one has a more natural voice, unlike Kid A.

Songs like Idioteque and The National Anthem, show Phillip's and the bands' ability to make a great rhythm. Idioteque is a weird song, but it somehow works thanks to whatever the frick they did with the drum machine and the synth. And as for The National Anthem, I love the motif and the *very* convoluted jazz part.

The most rageful song in the album is probably Optimistic (despite the name) and damn the lyrics in this one are just all over the place but they manage to make it work... somehow. Not my favorite track but I like it quite a lot, and I see how many ppl would get obsessed over it.

Treefingers does ambient quite nicely, though it mostly serves as an interlude track, so does [untilted].

Morning Bell is another one of those amazing 5/4 songs that I like (I love 5/4 songs) and well it doesn't disappoint. I say it's way better than the 4/4 version in Amnesiac. The beat is just so well done, though it's a hard to read 5/4, it keeps that shuffle-like feeling these kinds of songs have.

And for last, my favorite track out of all of them, Motion Picture Soundtrack... I guess that says a lot about me üòÅ. It's just a beautiful song. There are no words to describe it. It's like reliving your whole life with a song. The layering is majestic. I love it.

Kid A is one of those one of a kind albums, there's nothing like it out there, and it truly deserves 5/5 stars. It sounds like if it was made today, it's a timeless piece of music and is one of the best albums of this century.
