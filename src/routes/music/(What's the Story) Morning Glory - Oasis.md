Hello - Love the distorted atmosphere, classic oasis smh

Roll With It - Not as strong as Hello bit still riffy as fk and cool

Wonderwall - Its wonderwall. Its a masterpiece in layering, vocals, guitar and lyrics.

Don't Look Back in Anger - Lovely track

Hey Now! - Very Oasis track like it too smh

[untilted] - Cool interlude, nice timbre

Some Might Say - The vocals on this one fit perfectly when layered witth the guitars omg

Cast No Shadow - Gud Track although the end is weird

She's Elctric - Pretty good album highlight

Morning Glory - Gud track

Champagne Supernova - Superb closer, pretty good lyrics

Overall a great album, it doesn't sound dated at all despite the fact that it was released at the peak of brit-pop.
Truly deserving of a 4.5/5. Many hit tracks, great interludes, and a great performance.

### Rating 4.5/5 ★★★★⯪
